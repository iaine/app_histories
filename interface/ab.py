        â€¢	Files to Inspect: Look for experimentation frameworks, often indicated by the use of libraries like Firebase A/B Testing or flag-based components in the code.
        â€¢	Tools: JADX for code analysis and grep for finding feature flags.
        o	Process:
        1.	Decompile APKs with JADX to inspect code directly. Search for keywords like "featureFlag" or specific A/B testing libraries.
        2.	Compare findings across versions to identify when features were in experimental phases or eventually deployed.
